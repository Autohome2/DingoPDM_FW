- I've gone through many iterations to test and learn the different systems/programming techniques. But, I am a hobbyist so a lot of the firmware is my best attempt
- To get to a basic stable firmware version I've removed a lot of content. 
- More features will be added as I test them
- Features removed to get to a basic stable version:
    - USB
        - Including sending new settings over serial
        - These are currently hardcoded
    - SPI
    - RTC
    - CRC
